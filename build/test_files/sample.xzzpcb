# Sample XZZPCB File for Testing

This is a sample file to demonstrate the file open dialog functionality.
While this is not a real XZZPCB file, it will show that the file open 
dialog is working correctly.

To test the PCB viewer:

1. Run the pcb_viewer.exe
2. Press Ctrl+O to open the file dialog
3. Navigate to this file and try to open it
4. The application will show an error (expected, since this isn't a real XZZPCB file)
5. The demo/sample PCB data will continue to be displayed

For real testing, you would need actual .xzzpcb files from PCB manufacturers.

## Instructions:
- Save this file as "sample.xzzpcb" to test the file dialog
- The viewer supports DES-encrypted XZZPCB files
- Use the mouse and keyboard controls to navigate the PCB view
